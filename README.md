# DMS Jbrowse Components

This package provides React components that use [JBrowse](https://jbrowse.org/jb2/) to visualize VCF and BAM files sourced from [Song](https://github.com/overture-stack/song) and [Score](https://github.com/overture-stack/score) data repositories. It has been built for use in the [DMS UI](https://github.com/overture-stack/dms-ui) as an optional visualization tool.
